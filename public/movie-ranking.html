 <h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>
 <hr>

 <h3>The Equalizer</h3>
 <p>This movies is one I can watch over and and over. The skill that Mr Washington possesses is pure gold</p>

 <h3>You got servered</h3>
 <p>As a dancer, this was one of the movies that raised me. I would learn all the routines in the livingroom, and to this day, I still remember them aswell as the dialogue</p>

 <h3>Best Man</h3>
 <p>One of thee black movies from my childhood. Growing up in my type of community, most movies were just white/caucasian peopl, so when I watch movies like Best amn, and a lot of Tyler Perry movies, I felt a connection that made me fall inlove with film even more, as I was now seeing black people on my screen, and not just black but dark-skinned people.</p>
