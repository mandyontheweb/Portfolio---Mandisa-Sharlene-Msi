<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I am an artist at heart and a problem solver by nature, so in web development I have found the perfect place to flourish.
    I worked for four years in the customer service department for an ecommerce site that specialises in food delivery.
    As time went by I felt very frustrated as the skills I had were not enough to satisfy my customers, which was my main goal.
    I realised that there are so many things that were either out of my control, or that I was unaware of when I pick up a call
    from a hangry customer wanting to know why their app is not updating even though their wifi is working fine. And because the
    promise of the business was to deliver the food fast and hot, it was very reasonable for the customer to complain, and expect
    me to have all the answers, because I should have. But I didn't, because the script doesn't say that, it says apologise and compensate.
    I also noticed that when I was well informed about system issues and could communicate it to the customer, they were less likely to escalate 
    the matter and ask for my manager. It didnt seem like solving the issue was a priority to the business. They figured, if we just offer free delivery,
    they'll shut up. That just wasn't enough for me though, and besides customers could tell. I wanted to have the answers to these honestly very simple questions, and most of all I wanted
    to prevent the issues from happening in the first place.

   <p>That was when I quit my job and enrolled into a Web Developement course on Udemy, where I could learn to not only solve the 
    current problems around me related to software, but also prevent future problems and create things that help make life a bit easier,
    that's why we have technology. One of the issues I currently face as an aspiring developer is
    lack of access to facilities, but I make up for that by learning as much as I can online. Part of my goals within the tech space is to 
    make it accessible in townships such as mine, make it exciting to young kids with potential to thrive in it, and help provide opportunities
    outside of the traditional things we're taught we need to do to succeed.

  <p>I am technically still a beginner and a student with big dreams and goals. But give me a few months.
